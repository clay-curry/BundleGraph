# Dynapack

Dynapack is a software stack to facilitate auto instrumentation, visual analysis, and automatic  performance tuning of bundler configs for dev-time, run-time, build-time, and X-time (X = you decide).

The Tracing Protocol ABI consists of the following binary interfaces that allow various processes in the operating system to contribute to tracing sessions and inject tracing data into the tracing service:



 bundler optimization 

. It offers services and libraries for recording system-level and app-level traces, native + java heap profiling, a library for analyzing traces using SQL and a web-based UI to visualize and explore multi-GB traces.

provides auto-instrumentation for Webpack

. It is a specification for how to receive, process, and export telemetry data. A single binary that can be deployed as an agent or gateway.

## Design Goals

Perhaps with this one topic more than all others combined, considerable effort is invested to elucidate possible logical structures a programmer might adopt to conceptualize structure of their codebase.

For maintainers, Dynapack is a framework for defining fundmamental units of work (a.k.a. ***spans***) relevant to the users of their codebase.

 both static and dynamic data, Dynapack can be used to analyze, validate, and optimize module systems and module bundlers at scale.




The task of tranforming a system of modules from one specification often delegated to "module bundlers". In
