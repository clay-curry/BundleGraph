Recall:

* Color hierarchy: Color can be used to express the order of importance in a UI.

* Typically, more saturated or concentrated colors will gain a user's attention first, this is why the Primary 
color role is mapped components that are more call to action focused. While the Material Theme Builder uses the 
M3 color system to generate appropriate colors, providing secondary or tertiary colors with higher saturation 
will create colors that outshine their Primary. Consider the order you wish your users to engage with amongst 
UI and content to help assign color roles, not all components should use Primary.

* When applying color roles to your mockups, consider the order of importance, or hierarchy, of your elements. 

* This concept will help assign colors to their respective role.

8. Extending past the core scheme
You now have a branded color theme mapped to components and design mock, but you may have additional colors that need to be included. That's where an extended scheme comes in to allow the addition of custom colors.

These can be semantic color, brand-specific, or even product-specific colors, which need to have roles assigned and shifted through the color algorithm or remain as inputted.

The extended color scheme also introduces the possibility of combining dynamic (user-generated) colors with your brand colors. Allow the core scheme to have personalized user influence, while brand colors are set in the extended scheme. This means the UI elements can be more personal to your users and your brand colors can have more precise impactful moments in the app.

The core scheme can be extended to include custom colors.

1. Design tokens point to style values like colors, fonts, and measurements

2. Use design tokens instead of hardcoded values

3. Each token is named for how or where it’s used (ex: md.fab.container.color sets the container color for a FAB)

4. Even if a token’s end value is changed, its name and use remain the same

5. Material Design has three kinds of tokens: reference, system, and component
