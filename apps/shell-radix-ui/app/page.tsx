        In biological-defined ecosystems, the evolution of individual members are

        fundamental laws of physics without exception. A dual characterization exists for members of 
        software-defined ecosystems programs, by outcomes of computation lawfully 
        following logic structures formed by the interface of programs with dependencies that 
        in turn follow from the interface of dependencies with transitive dependencies.

        Software ecosystems, like their biological counterparts, are dynamic entities
        whose health (likelihood of growth and persistence) is measured by their ability 
        to generate diverse, well-formed members that live in harmony with others in the 
        pursuit of goals auxillary to their existence. By some means of interfacing with 
        other programs, a beneficial exchange of functionality allows primal programs
        to produce highly-structured systems of programs spontaneously producing new functionality.
