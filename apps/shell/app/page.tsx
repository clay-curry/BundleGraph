        Few truths, if any, go underappreciated to the degree of computation and the capacity of a program to evoke spontaneous utility outside the constraints of its original 
        conception. Indeed, such ability is bounded only by the nature of logic in communication with dependencies, and, likewise, by the interface of its dependencies with those transitive to the program.
